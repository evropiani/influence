## 🎯 The whole game in 10 seconds

You have **influence**. It buys land — one point per cell. Land and captured **nodes** make more influence. Hold the most ground when the clock stops (**Classic**) or be the last one standing (**Battle royale**). Everything else is spice.

- **Bright** enemy land is fresh, soft, and cheap to take. **Dark** land is dug in and expensive.
- Nodes 🎯 pay income, raise your influence cap, and extend your reach. Steal an enemy's for a fat bonus.
- Grey **rock barriers** ⬜ carve up the map — impassable, and new ones form *mid-round*. No sniping across open ground.
- Lose your **base** ⭐ and your income drops 30% until you rebuild.

## 🧰 Your toolbar

| Key | Tool | Cost | What it does |
|:---:|------|-----:|--------------|
| `1` | **Wall** | 20 | 25 durability. Attacks chip it down and leave visible **cracks**. (`Ctrl`+click also paints) |
| `2` | **Farm** | 400 | +120 influence every 15s, raises your cap. Economy engine. |
| `3` | **Outpost** | 300 | Chews up to 40 cells every 12s, prefers enemy land, acts as a **forward supply point**. Spearhead. |
| `4` | **Bomb** | 250 | Blast a crater out of enemy territory anywhere in supply range. On a cooldown. Outposts extend its reach. |

## 🕹️ Controls

| | PC | Mobile |
|---|---|---|
| Grow | Click toward target | Tap toward target |
| Pan / Zoom | Drag / wheel (WASD too) | Drag / pinch |
| Tools | Keys `1`–`4` or bottom bar | Bottom bar |
| Jump | Click minimap | Tap minimap |

## 🤖 Modes & bots

- **Classic** — most territory when the clock runs out wins.
- **Battle royale** — no timer, last one standing wins.
- **The Zone** 🔴 — a circular map that collapses in **5 phases** (2 min each) toward a **random** spot — a red ring warns you 20 seconds ahead. Whatever falls outside is crushed, *including nodes* — and their cap and income die with them.
- **2v2 / 3v3** ⚔️ — bot allies in **your colour**. No friendly fire, shared supply range, most combined ground wins.
- **Difficulty** — Easy / Normal / Hard. Harder bots think faster, commit harder, and build farms and outposts of their own. Up to **99** opponents, if you're feeling brave.

Self-contained vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no build step, no dependencies, no framework.

## 🚀 Running locally

Open `influence.html` in a browser, or serve the folder:

```
npx serve .
```

## 🔧 Tuning

All game balance lives in the `CONFIG` object at the top of `influence.js` — map size, node count, incomes, costs, wall durability, barrier density, bot difficulty profiles (`DIFFS`). Tweak and reload.

## 📦 Deployment

Two hosts, both updated automatically on every push to `main`:

- **GitHub Pages** — built and served straight from this repo.
- **Mirror** — `.github/workflows/deploy-cpanel.yml` syncs the site via FTPS to a personal server (credentials live in the repo's Actions secrets).

## 💬 Feedback

It's a beta — expect things to change, break, and get better. Ideas, bugs, balance gripes: [@evropiani on Discord](https://discord.com/users/319246364246540288/).
